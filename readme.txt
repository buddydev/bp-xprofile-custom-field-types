Buddypress Xprofile Custom Field Types adds extra custom profile fields to BuddyPress. Field types are: Birthdate, Email, Url etc.

== Description ==
BuddyPress Xprofile Custom Field Types plugin adds some essential field types to BuddyPress Profile.

BuddyPress Xprofile Custom Field Types is 100% compatible with [BP Profile Search plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-profile-search/).

The newly added BuddyPress field types are:-
* Birthdate.
* Image.
* File.
* Checkbox acceptance.
* Country field.
* From/To field(can be used to show 2 numbers or text strings).
* Token (can be used to set a list of predefined approved codes for registration etc).
* oEmbed ( allow your users to use youtube/facebook, vimeo and other oembed supporting urls to embed in their profile).
* [Email](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.email.html "Input type email - HTML5").
* [Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.url.html "Input type url - HTML5").
* [Datepicker](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-html-markup-20130528/input.date.html "Input type date - HTML5").
* Custom post type selector.
* Custom post type multiselector.
* [Colorpicker](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-html-markup-20130528/input.color.html "Input type color - HTML5").
* Decimal number.
* Number within min/max values.
* Custom taxonomy selector.
* Custom taxonomy multiselector.
* Range input (slider)
* [Select2 javascript plugin](https://select2.github.io/) for select boxes.

The plugin is opensource and currently developed on github. We welcome you to be part of its future development at [https://github.com/buddydev/bp-xprofile-custom-field-types](https://github.com/buddydev/bp-xprofile-custom-field-types).

Discuss the plugin on our [release post](https://buddydev.com/add-extra-buddypress-profile-fields-with-buddypress-xprofile-custom-field-types-plugin/) or view the plugin's [detailed documentation here](https://buddydev.com/plugins/bp-xprofile-custom-field-types/).
The idea is based on @donmik's plugin. This plugin is a complete rewrite. Some field type do share code with the original plugin. My guess, we are using 20-30% of the code for field types from the original.

In future, we hope to add more fields.

**Note: This plugin is not 100% backward compatible**
It is very easy to migrate. Should take less than 5 minute. If you are looking to move from the older plugin to this one, please read our [migration guide](https://buddydev.com/plugins/bp-xprofile-custom-field-types/#migrate).

**Note 2: The Custom taxonomy field does not allow you to categorize users. They allow you to let users select some terms and display the terms on their profile.
           It is not intended for classifying user**

 In the first version, te plugin brought all the profile fields offered by the currently abandoned The ["BuddyPress Xprofile Custom Fields Type"](https://github.com/donmik/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type) plugin.
